Welcome to the Durobeach Restaurant.

Our beachside restaurant is open every day, also for non-hotel guests, offering delicious, international and local dishes, snacks, finger food and smoothies.
 
The bar at Durobeach is the ideal place to chill out with a cold beer or a refreshing cocktail. Try out our Caipirinhas, Mojitos and Margaritas, or healthy smoothies like the typical energizing drink Açai, made of an extremely vitamin-rich fruit from the Amazon.

Kick back and relax in our beach chairs under the palm trees with a cocktail or some finger food. Have a chat with your friends or simply overlook the beautiful beach enjoying low beat jazzy tunes from our Resident or guest DJ's.
