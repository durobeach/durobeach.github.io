Durobeach hotel, restaurant and kite center is located at the beach and right in the heart of the idyllic place called Cumbuco, just 30 minutes away from the vibrant city Fortaleza. Cumbuco is a small fisher village that has gained its fame thanks to its breathtaking environment: a laid back village centre surrounded by white sand dunes and lagoons, endless beaches and coconut trees.

Staying with us will make you feel part of this paradise from the moment you arrive. Wake up with a magical sea view and go to sleep with the sound of the waves. The tropical decoration and boutique hotel style of our rooms go hand in hand with modern infrastructure. Relax on your veranda, get a massage or have a drink by the pool. Or if you like kitesurfing just take your gear out of your locker and go riding in front. The staff of our kite surf school  will be happy to assist the sportive guests. Durobeach is one of the few beachfront Cumbuco hotels which makes it the perfect accommodation to windsurf or kite surf, or just to relax.

We will do everything to provide you a high comfort and service quality that make your stay unforgettable.  
Welcome to Cumbuco beach,  
Enjoy our hospitality and come and visit us soon!!
